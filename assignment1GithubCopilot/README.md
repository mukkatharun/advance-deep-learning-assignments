Assignment 1 : Use  AI Pair Programmer(Github copilot) . Play with recent ML model demos and produce some cool artifacts

 

As discussed you need to provide video of you using github copilot in visual studio code and having it code some interesting projects.

a) Keras based neural network model and Pytorch based neural network model

You can add any other coding like backend, frontend and html demos if you want.

Record and upload to youtube and put the link in github 

 

Also if you have any great extensions/tips you found in visual studio code, include that in the video and demo your setup.

 

b) As i demoed in the class, try  out interesting online AI demos with creative inputs . 

Collect the outputs in a nice read.me file explaining how you did it

Do a video showcasing these outputs and how you did it.

Try to include at least 10 cool demos - you can include more if you want.

Record the video with slide deck to youtube and put the link in github along with artifacts like images you created

 

Publish the links in github directory named assignment 1-> part A folder and part B folder

 

Also publish your two assignment links to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UU2-sfj1ICBhfLiZbv9D51-BNikX6GWxvvafrlNaIQY/edit#gid=0 (Links to an external site.)

In addition to what i shown NVIDIA has cool demos

 

so other students can also see and learn

 

We will go over few demos and have students also review and vote for best ones
